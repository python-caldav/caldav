"""
Calendar Objects Resources, as defined in the RFC 4791.

There are three subclasses Todo, Journal and Event.  Those mirrors objects stored on the server.  The word ``CalendarObjectResource`` is long, complicated and may be hard to understand.  When you read the word "event" in any documentation, issue discussions, etc, then most likely it should be read as "a CalendarObjectResource, like an event, a task or a journal".  Do not make the mistake of going directly to the Event-class if you want to contribute code for handling "events" - consider that the same code probably will be appicable to Joural and Todo events, if so, CalendarObjectResource is the right class!  Clear as mud?

FreeBusy is also defined as a Calendar Object Resource in the RFC, and it is a bit different .  Perhaps there should be another class layer between CalendarObjectResource and Todo/Event/Journal to indicate that the three latter are closely related, while FreeBusy is something different.

Alarms and Time zone objects does not have any class as for now.  Those are typically subcomponents of an event/task/journal component.

Users of the library should not need to construct any of those objects.  To add new content to the calendar, use ``calendar.save_event``, ``calendar.save_todo`` or ``calendar.save_journal``.  Those methods will return a CalendarObjectResource.

        True by default, it will be ignored if all_recurrences is set.

        fixed deadlines and preserve information from the previous
        dtstart.  If no BY*-parameters are present, assume the
        frequency is meant to be the interval between the tasks.

        Examples:

        1) Garbage collection happens every week on a Tuesday, but
        never earlier than 09 in the morning.  Hence, it may be
        important to take out the thrash Monday evenings or Tuesday
        morning.  DTSTART of the original task is set to Tuesday
        2022-11-01T08:50, DUE to 09:00.

        1A) Task is completed 07:50 on the 1st of November.  Next
        DTSTART should be Tuesday the 7th of November at 08:50.

        1B) Task is completed 09:15 on the 1st of November (which is
        probably OK, since they usually don't come before 09:30).
        Next DTSTART should be Tuesday the 7th of November at 08:50.

        1C) Task is completed at the 5th of November.  We've lost the
        DUE, but the calendar has no idea weather the DUE was a very
        hard due or not - and anyway, probably we'd like to do it
        again on Tuesday, so next DTSTART should be Tuesday the 7th of
        November at 08:50.

        1D) Task is completed at the 7th of November at 07:50.  Next
        DTSTART should be one hour later.  Now, this is very silly,
        but an algorithm cannot do guesswork on weather it's silly or
        not.  If DTSTART would be set to the earliest possible time
        one could start thinking on this task (like, Monday evening),
        then we would get Tue the 14th of November, which does make
        sense.  Unfortunately the icalendar standard does not specify
        what should be used for DTSTART and DURATION/DUE.

        1E) Task is completed on the 7th of November at 08:55.  This
        efficiently means we've lost the 1st of November recurrence
        but have done the 7th of November recurrence instead, so next
        timestamp will be the 14th of November.

        2) Floors at home should be cleaned like once a week, but
        there is no fixed deadline for it.  For some people it may
        make sense to have a routine doing it i.e. every Tuesday, but
        this is not a strict requirement.  If it wasn't done one
        Tuesday, it's probably even more important to do it Wednesday.
        If the floor was cleaned on a Saturday, it probably doesn't
        make sense cleaning it again on Tuesday, but it probably
        shouldn't wait until next Tuesday.  Rrule is set to
        FREQ=WEEKLY, but without any BYDAY.  The original VTODO is set
        up with DTSTART 16:00 on Tuesday the 1st of November and DUE
        17:00.  After 17:00 there will be dinner, so best to get it
        done before that.

        2A) Floor cleaning was finished 14:30.  The next recurrence
        has DTSTART set to 13:30 (and DUE set to 14:30).  The idea
        here is that since the floor starts accumulating dirt right
        after 14:30, obviously it is overdue at 16:00 Tuesday the 7th.

        2B) Floor cleaning was procrastinated with one day and
        finished Wednesday at 14:30.  Next instance will be Wednesday
        in a week, at 14:30.

        2C) Floor cleaning was procrastinated with two weeks and
        finished Tuesday the 14th at 14:30. Next instance will be
        Tuesday the 21st at 14:30.

        While scenario 2 is the most trivial to implement, it may not
        be the correct understanding of the RFC, and it may be tricky
        to get the RECURRENCE-ID set correctly.
