"""This text was updated 2025-05-17.  The plan is to reorganize this
file a lot over the next few months, see
https://github.com/python-caldav/caldav/issues/402

This file serves as a database of different compatibility issues we've
encountered while working on the caldav library, and descriptions on
how the well-known servers behave.

As for now, this is a list of binary "flags" that could be turned on
or off.  My experience is that there are often neuances, so the
compatibility matrix will be changed from being a list of flags to a
key=value store in the near future (at least, that's the plan).

The issues may be grouped together, maybe even organized
hierarchically.  I did consider organizing the compatibility issues in
some more advanced way, but I don't want to overcomplicate things - I
will try out the key-value-approach first.
"""
## The lists below are specifying what tests should be skipped or
## modified to accept non-conforming resultsets from the different
## calendar servers.  In addition there are some hacks in the library
## code itself to work around some known compatibility issues, like
## the caldav.lib.vcal.fix function.
## Here is a list of all observed (in)compatibility issues the test framework needs to know about
## TODO:
## * references to the relevant parts of the RFC would be nice.
## * Research should be done to triple-check that the issue is on the server side, and not on the client side
## * Some of the things below should be possible to probe the server for.
## * Perhaps some more readable format should be considered (yaml?).
## * Consider how to get this into the documentation
