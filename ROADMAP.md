I should make some system for automatic syncing between this document and https://github.com/python-caldav/caldav/issues/474 - currently the latter has been updated while this one hasn't.

### GitHub Issues vs Git

The GitHub issues features easy possibilities for feedback and comments for any GitHub user and it features better linking (with embedded information on what issues and pull requests are merged/fixed/closed).  It also does have the history available.

Having the roadmap in the repository itself provides platform-independence (there is much talk in Europe nowadays that it's needed to have a "Plan B" or an "Exit plan" and not depend too much on cloud services in the USA), it also preserves the history of the document in a standard way with zero trust needed.

I would like to have both, and it should be easily programmable, but I have other priorities so I'm not fixing it now, and manually syncing it is too much of a pain (and will inevitably cause inconsistencies).
