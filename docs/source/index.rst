.. python-caldav documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Python 3
========

The caldav library should work well both with python2 and python3.

Quickstart
==========

.. code-block:: python

  from datetime import datetime
  import caldav
  from caldav.elements import dav, cdav
  
  # Caldav url
  url = "https://user:pass@hostname/caldav.php/"
  
  vcal = """BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  VERSION:2.0
  PRODID:-//Example Corp.//CalDAV Client//EN
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  UID:1234567890
  DTSTAMP:20100510T182145Z
  DTSTART:20100512T170000Z
  DTEND:20100512T180000Z
  SUMMARY:This is an event
  END:VEVENT
  END:VCALENDAR
  """
  
  client = caldav.DAVClient(url)
  principal = client.principal()
  calendars = principal.calendars()
  if len(calendars) > 0:
      calendar = calendars[0]
      print "Using calendar", calendar
  
      print "Renaming"
      calendar.set_properties([dav.DisplayName("Test calendar"),])
      print calendar.get_properties([dav.DisplayName(),])
  
      event = calendar.add_event(vcal)
      print "Event", event, "created"
  
      print "Looking for events in 2010-05"
      results = calendar.date_search(
          datetime(2010, 5, 1), datetime(2010, 6, 1))

      for event in results:
          print "Found", event

More examples
=============

See the `test code <https://bitbucket.org/cyrilrbt/caldav/src/default/tests/test_caldav.py?at=default>`_ for more usage examples.  Tobias Brox is also working on a `command line interface <https://github.com/tobixen/calendar-cli>`_  built around the caldav library.

Notable classes and workflow
============================

 * You'd always start by initiating a :class:`caldav.davclient.DAVClient`
   object, this object holds the authentication details for the
   server.

 * From the client object one can get hold of a
   :class:`caldav.objects.Principal`
   object representing the logged in principal.

 * From the principal object one can fetch / generate
   :class:`caldav.objects.Calendar` objects.  Calendar objects can also be
   instantiated directly from an absolute or relative URL and the client 
   object.

 * From the calendar object one can fetch / generate
   :class:`caldav.objects.Event` objects and
   :class:`caldav.objects.Todo` objects.  Event objects can also be
   instantiated directly from an absolute or relative URL and the client
   object.

Note that those are also available as :class:`caldav.DAVClient`,
:class:`caldav.Principal`, :class:`caldav.Calendar`,
:class:`caldav.Event` and :class:`caldav.Todo`.


Compatibility
=============

The test suite is regularly run against Baikal, DAViCal, Zimbra
and Bedework.  Some compatibility issues have been found, search the
test code for "COMPATIBILITY" for details.  Notably;

 * You may want to avoid non-ASCII characters in the calendar name, or
   some servers (at least Zimbra) may behave a bit unexpectedly.

 * How would you expect the result to be when doing date searches
   spanning multiple instances of a recurring event?  Would you expect
   one ical object for each occurrence (and maybe that's why
   open-ended date searches tend to break at some implementations) or
   one recurring ical object?  Different servers behave a bit
   differently (but more research is needed on this one).

 * Date search for future instances or recurring events does not seem
   to work in Bedework.

 * There are some special hacks both in the code and the tests to work
   around compatibility issues in Zimbra.

 * The Radicale caldav server seems to be too radical - lots and lots
   of tests fails towards it.

 * Bedework and Zimbra does not support journal entries (but who uses those
   anyway?).

 * Bedework is supposed to support todo-lists, but queries
   for "all non-completed tasks" does not work.

 * iCloud - we've managed read-only access to iCloud so far - see
   https://bitbucket.org/cyrilrbt/caldav/issue/40/icloud-not-fully-supported
   for details.

Unit testing
============

To start the tests code, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python setup.py nosetests

Note that there is a big bug in the functional tests; if the test
suite is run in parallell towards the same servers/principals, some
tests will fail or raise exceptions, and this may very well happen if
multiple developers runs the tests at the same time.  This hasn't been
a problem so far.

It will run some unit tests and some functional tests against some
dedicated caldav servers hosted by Tobias Brox.  You may add your own
private servers into tests/conf_private.py, like this:

.. code-block:: python

  caldav_servers = [{
      "url": "https://myserver.example.com:80/caldav.php/",
      'username': 'testuser',
      'password': 'hunter2'}]

the dict may contain:
 * username and password (if not embedded in the URL)
 * principal_url (used to verify client.principal().url)
 * backwards_compatibility_url (deprecated - URLs that worked with caldav versions prior to 0.2 goes here)

Documentation
=============

To build the documentation, install sphinx and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python setup.py build_sphinx
