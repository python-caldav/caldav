 Documentation: caldav |release|
=================================

This is the Python CalDAV client library, making communication with calendaring servers easy.

NOTE: version 3 introduces quite some new API.  The documentation has been AI-maintained to reflect this, causing two potential problems:

* The quality of the doc may be varying.  I will get back to it and do proper QA on the documentation when I have my hands free.
* This is the v3-documentation.  If you're stuck on v2, then quite some of the instructions in this documentation will not work for you.
