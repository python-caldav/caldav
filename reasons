* Communication, bug reporting, collaboration with other actors, server developers etc
* All since summer I've been quite busy with other problems, not having time to focus on the CalDAV library.  Development goes slower when there are long interruptions, as context is forgotten, and it also means there are more issues, pull requests etc requiring attention.
* I was encouraged to fork out icalendar-searcher and caldav-server-checker as separate projects/packages rather than keeping them as part of the caldav package.  This is definitively "best practice" as it will make those packages more easily available for peope not needing the caldav client library, but has caused quite some extra overhead in setting up the package infrastructure, releasing it, etc.
* Also, as changes in those three packages has to be developed in lockstep, and releases has to be made to get the checks pass in tox and in the GitHub CI-pipelines, it has caused a considerable overhead and mental load for me.
* Functional tests towards slow caldav servers worked in one moment, and then it suddenly fails in the next moment.  It may be due to changes done on the server side, but it may also be me introducing some new compatibility-problems in the caldav library.  With three separate packages, I found tools like git bisect to be ineffective.
