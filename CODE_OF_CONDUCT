I hope and believe we'll never need to refer to the Code of Conduct
for the Python CalDAV client library, but if the need should arise:
The "Contributor Covenant" applies to this project, currently version
2.1 at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/ .
This applies to activities on the GitHub platform (issues and pull
requests), documentation, code, comments in the code, and other
project-related communication.

I would point out the importantance of avoiding toxic negativity.
Some of us contributes to open source projects for the fun of it and
not for profit - negativity can ruin the fun.  Kenneth Reiz has a good
essay about this at https://kennethreitz.org/essays/2013/be_cordial_or_be_on_your_way .
That said, personally I'm all ears for suggestions on how to improve
the CalDAV library - even if that includes blunt criticism of the work
I've done.

Specific for this project, we should probably strive not to use too
many negative adjectives on server implementations, even when they
break all the standards badly.  I may not have been very good at this
earlier (and I may not have weeded out all he negativity from the
mastar branch yet), but I'm striving to improve myself.  While the
RFCs may seem sub-optimal or ambiguous sometimes, accusing the authors
for being stupid, evil or corrupt is clearly way out of the line.

The main branch for this project is called "master".  If the project
was made today, the name of the branch would be "main.  For ME, I
cannot understand how naming a git-branch "master" can be offensive -
but if YOU get offended by it, please notify me.  I will not quesion
it, and I will not hold you responsible for it, I will just rename the
branch.

Unacceptable behavior may be reported to Tobias Brox, the current
maintainer of the project.  The email address coc-abuse@plann.no may
be used.  If complaining to Tobias doesn't help, you may try reaching
out to the original maintainer and owner of the project, Cyril Robert.
If Tobias is the subject of the complaint, you may want to put Cyril
on the Cc-list in your complaint.  His email address can be found
through http://scr.im/22q7
