# Policy on usage of Artifical Intelligence and other tools

## Read this first

The most important rule: Inform about it!

If you've spent hours, perhaps a full day of your time writing up a
pull request, then I sort of owe you something.  I should spend some
of my time looking through the submission carefully, and if nothing
else, I owe to be polite, respectful and guide you in the right
direction or give a good explanation for why I think your pull request
is pulling the project in the wrong direction.  A human being have
feelings, I should be careful not to hurt your feelings.

At the other hand, perhaps you've spent 30 seconds either doing `ruff
check --fix ; gh pr create` or telling Claude to check what went wrong
in the logs and submit a bugfix upstream.  Do I still owe
you to spend time looking through the submission carefully and
spending time being polite and caring about your feelings?

Perhaps your pull request is just one out of many such "drive-by pull
requests".  It doesn't scale for a maintainer to spent lots of time on
each such pull request.  I should just accept or decline such requests
rapidly with minimum effort.

So it all boils down to this: Be honest about tool usage!

## Background

The "30 second effort pull request" mentioned above may have value to
the project, but it's dishonest to not be transparent about it.
Sometimes, teaching me how to run the tool and integrating it into the
CI workflow may have a bigger value than the changes provided by the
tool.

Starting in 2025-11, I've spent quite some time testing Claude.  I'm
positively surprised, it's doing a much better job than what I had
expected.  The AI may do things a lot faster, smarter and better than
a good coder.  Sometimes.  Other times it may spend a lot of "tokens"
and a long time coming up with sub-optimal or really bad solutions.

Perhaps at some time in the near future the AI will do the developer
profession completely obsoleted - but as of 2026-02, my experiences is
that the AI performs best when being "supervised" and "guided" by a
good coder knowing the project.

## Bugfixes are (most often) welcome

Over the past month, playing with a "max" subscription with Claude,
I've made it into a rule that when I stumble upon some weird bug in
some software or libraries I'm using or dependent on, I always ask
Claude to analyze the bug, check the outstanding issues in the
project, either create a new issue or consider if there is anything of
value to add to an existing issue, and come up with a pull-request.  Being a bit aware of the

## General rules

* Do **respect the maintainers time**.  If/when the maintainer gets
  overwhelmed by pull requests of questionable quality or pull
  requests that do not pull the project in the right direction, then
  it will be needed to add more requirements to the Contributors
  Guidelines.

* **YOU should add value to the project**. If your contribution
  consists of nothing else than using a tool on the code and
  submitting the resulting code, then the value is coming from the
  tool and not from you.  I could probably have used the tool myself.
  Ok, so you may have done some research, found the tool, installed it
  locally, maybe paid money for a subscription, for sure there is some
  value in that - but if you end up as a messenger copying my comments
  to some AI tools and copying the answer back again - then you're not
  delivering value anymore, then it would be better if the AI tool
  itself would be delivering the pull request and responding to my
  comments.

* **YOU should look through and understand the changes**.  The change
  goes into the project attributed to your name (or at least github
  handle), so I do expect you to at least understand the change you're
  proposing.

* **Transparency** is important.  Ok, so a lot of tools may have been
  used while writing the pull request. I don't need to know what
  editor you're using, the version of git or the color of the T-shirt
  you're wearing.  However, if significant part of the changes (and/or
  value of the pull request) was generated by some tool or by some AI,
  then that should be informed about.  Say, you ran `ruff` on the code
  and found some imporant things that should be changed, even if those
  things are manually changed significant parts of the value of the
  pull request comes from ruff.  Do not write "I found this issue and
  here is a fix", but rather "I ran the ruff tool on the code, found
  this issue, and here is the fix".  If some AI was used for
  generating significant parts of the code changs, then it should be
  informed about both in the pull request itself and in the git commit
  message.  The most common way to do this is to add "Assisted-by:
  (name of AI-tool)" at the end of the message.  Claude seems to sign
  off with `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` when it's
  doing commits, that's also OK.

* **YOU** should be ready to follow up and respond to feedback and
  questions on the contribution.  If you're letting the AI do this for
  you, then you're neither honest nor adding value to the project.
  You should at least do a quick QA on the AI-answer and acknowledge
  that it was generated by the AI.

* The Contributors Guidelines aren't strongly enforced on this project
  as of 2026-02, and I can hardly see cases where the AI would break
  the Code of Conduct, but at the end of the day, it's **YOUR**
  responsibility that the contribution follows those guidelines.
