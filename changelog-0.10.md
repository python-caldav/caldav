# Changelog v0.9.2 -> v0.10.1

## Warning

v0.10 does introduce some "bugfixes" and refactorings which may be be breaking your production evironment.  In particular:

* The `obj.data` property has always been inconsistent - sometimes a string would be returned, other times a bytestring, sometimes with ordinary linebreaks, other times with CRLN.  However,it has at least been deterministic dependent on the usage pattern.  Now `obj.data` will always return a string with ordinary linebreaks, while `obj.wire_data` always will return a bytestring including the carriage return character in the linebreaks.  Please have a look through your application and ensure you use `obj.wire_data` if "wire data" is required, and `obj.data` if ordinary strings is required.  (if this breaks too much, I'm considering to create `obj.data` as a legacy thing, and replace it with `obj.string_data`)
* The icalendar library is now used even for ensuring that the uid is correctly set when saving an object to the calendar. This should be a noop, but may have negligible side effects i.e. reordering of the properties before sending the data to the server (if I get reports that this actually is a problem for anyone, I will change it to using regexps instead).
* The sequence number was not increased before, now the sequence number is increased on every save to the server if there exists a sequence number.  It's possible to bypass this logic by doing `obj.save(increase_seqno=False)`

## Quick summary

* Work on a universal search method
  * Refactoring, consolidated lots of slightly duplicated code into one method to rule them all
  * Support for things needed by the calendar-cli utility, like search by categories
* Support for completion of recurring tasks
* More utilities for tasks
  * Uncomplete-method ... for undoing the complete (recurrences not supported though)
  * get/set duration/dtstart/dtend (arguably this belongs to vobject and/or icalendar)
* Other improvements:
  * picklable URLs
  * display_name convenience method
  * possible to set child/parent relationships
* Potential bugfix: sequence number may need to be increased when saving something to the calendar
* `obj.data` (which could return bytes or strings depending on usage patterns of the library) has now been changed into `obj.data` and `obj.wire_data`.

## Search method

Calendar now has a method search.  Here is some information from the docstring:

Parameters supported:

* xml - use this search query, and ignore other filter parameters
* comp_class - set to event, todo or journal to restrict search to this
  resource type.  Some server implementations require this to be set.
* todo - sets comp_class to Todo, and restricts search to pending tasks,
  unless the next parameter is set ...
* include_completed - include completed tasks
* event - sets comp_class to event
* text attribute search parameters: category, uid, summary, omment,
  description, location, status
* expand - do server side expanding of recurring events/tasks
* start, stop: do a time range search
* filters - other kind of filters (in lxml tree format)
* sort_keys - list of attributes to use when sorting

not supported yet:

* negated text match
* attribute not set

## Completed tasks

While the RFCs do support recurring tasks, they are not very clear on the details.  In v0.10 there are three different ways to complete a task.  The first one is to ignore the RRULE property and mark the task as completed.  This is the backwards-compatibility mode - though, according to my understanding of a "recurring task" this is the wrong way to do it.
The two other modes considers the task to be "interval based" is no BY-rules are specified in the RRULE - meaning that if a task is supposed to be done weekly, then a week should pass from it was completed and until one needs to start with it again - no matter the DTSTART of the original instance - but the standards may also be interpreted so that if the original task was to be started at a Tuesday 10:00, then all recurrences should be started at a Tuesday 10:00.

Both the modes stores a copy of the completed task, for the record.  The "safe" mode stores the copy as a completely independent task, and modifies the DTSTART/DUE of the original task - so the completed task is not linked up to the recurring task.  (One may eventually try to make a link by establishing a "parent task").

The "thisandfuture"-mode will establish the completed task as a separate recurrence in a recurrence set.  The non-completed task is also duplicated with a new DTSTART set and range set to THISANDFUTURE. As I understand the RFC, this is the way to handle interval-based tasks, future recurrences will then base their starting time on the DTSTART of the THISANDFUTURE task.  For fixed tasks the THISANDFUTURE recurrence is moot, so I'm considering to create a third mode as well.
