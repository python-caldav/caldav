	* caldav/lib/url.py (make): function for backward compatibility

	* tests/: more test code, including backward compatibility test

2014-02-16  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/namespace.py: fixing issue
	https://bitbucket.org/cyrilrbt/caldav/issue/29/centos59-minifix

2013-12-12  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): compatibility hack for zimbra -
	gotcha!  Use Calendar display name in the Calendar URL instead of
	Calendar ID.

	* caldav/objects.py: internal change - _create method now returns
	nothing, but sets self.url and self.id instead.

2013-12-11  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject): convenience fix - made client a
	conditional parameter to __init__.  Defaults to parent.client if
	parent is given.

	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): convenience fix - made methods
	Calendar.event_by_uid and Calendar.event_by_url.  Calendar.event
	is an alias to Calendar.event_by_uid for backwards compatibility.
	Those methods also loads the object from the remote server (hmmm
	... does that make sense, it's inconsistent with the
	CalendarSet.calendar method)

	* caldav/objects.py (Event): a potential compatibility fix - when
	creating an event, some servers seems to want the uid to match the
	URL (zimbra will yield 302 on the PUT request).  However, I wasn't
	able to GET the event from zimbra, neither before nor after this
	fix :-(

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py: compatibility fix - collation 
	"i; octet" (with whitespace) not recognized by baikal.  "i;octet"
	(without whitespace) is OK.

2013-12-08  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): Convenience fix: method add_event
	for making it easier to add events.  Better error handling; if
	calendar creation succeeds but setting calendar name fails, delete
	the calendar before raising the exception.

	* caldav/objects.py (Event): Bugfix for zimbra - 302 is now an
	acceptable return code when creating a new event.

2013-12-07  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.request, DAVResponse): Full HTTP
	communication is now available in debug logs

	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.__init__): Username and password
	can now (optionally) be given as separate parameters instead of as
	a part of the configuration URL

	* caldav/objects.py: By now it's sufficient to pass the base URL
	while initializing the DAVClient object.  The library will find
	the principal URL and home calendar set URL through GETPROP

	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): workaround for problem that
	calendar name didn't get set on some (all?) caldav servers.

	* caldav/objects.py (Principal, CalendarSet): created a method
	calendar() to make it easier to generate a calendar object
	(without server-side communication), and make_calendar for
	creating a new calendar at the server side.

	* tests/test_caldav.py: all broken tests have been disabled.
	Temporary made smaller tests to demonstrate what is actually
	working on all caldav servers I've tested against (Zimbra,
	DAViCal, Baikal and SoGo).

	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject): (internal change) set __str__ and
	__repr__ to make debugging easier

	* caldav/objects.py: (internal change) Since the principal path and the calendar
	home set path are different on most CALDav server implementations,
	a new class CalendarSet has been made.

	* caldav/lib/url.py: (internal change) Complete rewrite and
	API-change. internally all URLs are now handled as objects

	* caldav/objects.py (Principal): (internal change) made it
	possible to set principal.calendar_home_set (hardly useful except
	for from the unit testing code).

	* All files: misc minor changes to reflect all the changes above.

2011-01-22  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py (Expand.__init__, 
							   TimeRange.__init__) : Fixed strftime fmt.

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py: Add Calendar, representing the calendar
	resource type.
	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject.children): Pull in code from
	_get_properties to enable PROPFINDs for properties with complex
	values.
