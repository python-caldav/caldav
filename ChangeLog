2015-04-21  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * caldav/elements/cdav.py - now support for the free-busy-query element.

	* caldav/objects.py - added FreeBusy and Journal objects, plus calendar methods to retrieve them, and for adding journal entries.

	* caldav/tests/test_caldav.py - added tests to add and fetch journal entries, and to request freebusy information.

2015-04-16  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/error.py - added error class for the propfind method.
	Made a dict index for method name -> exception class.

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py - bugfix - "negate-condition", not
	"negate" in the TextMatch class.  Added
	SupportedCalendarComponentSet class.

	* caldav/elements/davclient.py - obscured the API a bit by
	allowing a dummy parameter to be passed to various methods.  Not
	very nice, but needed for the refactoring work in objects.py.

	* caldav/objects.py - VTODO support, new class for Todo-items with
	method for completing the task.  Calendar creation methods takes a
	list of supported element types as optional parameter.  Quite some
	refactoring, consolidating similar-looking code.  Minor bugfix
	with the event date search - asking for an expanded event list
	with an open end date is not supported by all server
	implementations, for obvious reasons.  Brushed up some docstrings
	and prefixed some internal methods with underscore.

	* caldav/tests/test_caldav.py - VTODO support, test code that
	creates a task list, adds todo-items to it, completes todo-items,
	list them out and deletes todo-items.

2015-04-01  Tobias Brox  <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py - started working on VTODO support

	* caldav/tests/test_caldav.py - started working on VTODO support

2015-04-01  Tobias Brox  <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * caldav/lib/url.py - work on python3-support

        * tests/conf.py - work on python3-support

2015-03-29  Tobias Brox  <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * caldav/objects.py - work on iCloud support.  Solves issue #38,
        read-only access to iCloud seems to work.  Writing still fails,
        ref issue #40.

2015-03-19  Tobias Brox  <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * tests/conf.py - ignore ImportError when importing conf_private,
        but not other exceptions.  This way conf_private will be ignored
        if it doesn't exist, but if there are syntax error, nosetest should
        bark.

2015-03-15  Tobias Brox  <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * caldav/lib/python_utilities.py - fixing broken charset

2015-02-26  Jack Laxson  <jackjrabbit@gmail.com>
        * setup.py - remove sphinx from install_requires as it is huge and only used 
        for generating the documentation.

2015-02-23  Luke  <github@woydziak.com>
        * Interceptable logging

2015-02-16  Luke  <github@woydziak.com>
        * python3 support

2015-02-14  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * tests/test_caldav.py - new test that deletes events

2015-01-24  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
        * caldav/davclient.py - support for digest auth and self-signed
        SSL certs, re issue #26 and #34.
        * tests/test_caldav.py - more generic URL checks to discover
        owncloud and baikal servers.

2015-01-21  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/url.py - workaround: "unauth"-method added port
	":None" if no port were given.

2015-01-19  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/url.py - added method strip_trailing_slash
	* caldav/objects.py - test breakages on several server
	implementations after the trailing slashes were removed.  Made a
	workaround, though this issue should be investigated better.

2014-05-27  Christian Roeder <christian.roeder@red-hood.de>
        * caldav/davclient.py - RFC compliance fix; Use capitalised Depth:
	Header

2014-05-27  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/url.py - Workaround for Zimbra; Zimbra generates
	non-ascii URLs when using non-ascii characters in the calendar
	name, hence the URL library must accept non-ascii characters.

2014-05-27  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* setup.py - include the requests library dependency

2014-05-20  Christian Roeder <christian.roeder@red-hood.de>
	* caldav/lib/url.py - Do not remove trailing slashes of all URLs.
	According to the RFC, all collection URLs should end with a
	trailing slash, though most caldav server implementations will
	handle URLs with and without trailing slashes the same.

2014-05-11  Abdul Rehman Gani <abdulg@gmail.com>
	* caldav/davclient.py - Change to use the requests library. Fixes
	several compatibility-issues, i.e. with iCloud a get_properties
	call would fail with a Path Handling exception. Happens when
	httplib specifies the netloc in the HTTP request, and the returned
	xml has the base path equal to that netloc instead of the path.

2014-04-13  Abdul Rehman Gani <abdulg@gmail.com>
	* caldav/davclient.py - Removed extraneous parameter passed to
	getresponse(); bugfix in a section not covered by test code

2014-03-14  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* General - more verbose documentation

	* caldav/test_caldav.py - added an exception for OwnCloud, it does
	not support open-ended date searches

2014-03-12  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* setup.py - version bump (0.2.2)

	* caldav/lib/url.py - battle hardening

	* caldav/objects.py - allowing for relative URLs to be used

	* caldav/test_caldav.py - test that relative URLs works as expected

	* caldav/test_caldav.py - test that the URL library is robust

2014-03-07  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/davclient.py - minor api difference; it feels more
	object-oriented to write principal = client.principal() than
	principal = Principal(client)

	* caldav/tests/test_caldav.py - work to reflect the above

	* docs/source/index.rst - work to reflect the above

	* docs/source/index.rst - added documentation that the tests may
	fail if several test runs are performed simultaneously

	* caldav/davclient.py - support for unicode and utf8

	* caldav/lib/url.py - support for unicode and utf8

	* caldav/objects.py - minor doc enhancement

	* tests/test_caldav.py - load an event or a calendar by the URL

	* tests/test_caldav.py - test calendar.events()

	* tests/test_caldav.py - test utf8 and unicode

	* docs/source/index.rst - documentation on how to run the test
	suite towards private calendar servers

	* setup.py - version bump (0.2.1)

2014-03-01  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/url.py (make): function for backward compatibility

	* tests/: more test code, including backward compatibility test

2014-02-16  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/lib/namespace.py: fixing issue
	https://bitbucket.org/cyrilrbt/caldav/issue/29/centos59-minifix

2013-12-12  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): compatibility hack for zimbra -
	gotcha!  Use Calendar display name in the Calendar URL instead of
	Calendar ID.

	* caldav/objects.py: internal change - _create method now returns
	nothing, but sets self.url and self.id instead.

2013-12-11  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject): convenience fix - made client a
	conditional parameter to __init__.  Defaults to parent.client if
	parent is given.

	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): convenience fix - made methods
	Calendar.event_by_uid and Calendar.event_by_url.  Calendar.event
	is an alias to Calendar.event_by_uid for backwards compatibility.
	Those methods also loads the object from the remote server (hmmm
	... does that make sense, it's inconsistent with the
	CalendarSet.calendar method)

	* caldav/objects.py (Event): a potential compatibility fix - when
	creating an event, some servers seems to want the uid to match the
	URL (zimbra will yield 302 on the PUT request).  However, I wasn't
	able to GET the event from zimbra, neither before nor after this
	fix :-(

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py: compatibility fix - collation 
	"i; octet" (with whitespace) not recognized by baikal.  "i;octet"
	(without whitespace) is OK.

2013-12-08  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): Convenience fix: method add_event
	for making it easier to add events.  Better error handling; if
	calendar creation succeeds but setting calendar name fails, delete
	the calendar before raising the exception.

	* caldav/objects.py (Event): Bugfix for zimbra - 302 is now an
	acceptable return code when creating a new event.

2013-12-07  Tobias Brox <t-caldav@tobixen.no>
	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.request, DAVResponse): Full HTTP
	communication is now available in debug logs

	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.__init__): Username and password
	can now (optionally) be given as separate parameters instead of as
	a part of the configuration URL

	* caldav/objects.py: By now it's sufficient to pass the base URL
	while initializing the DAVClient object.  The library will find
	the principal URL and home calendar set URL through GETPROP

	* caldav/objects.py (Calendar): workaround for problem that
	calendar name didn't get set on some (all?) caldav servers.

	* caldav/objects.py (Principal, CalendarSet): created a method
	calendar() to make it easier to generate a calendar object
	(without server-side communication), and make_calendar for
	creating a new calendar at the server side.

	* tests/test_caldav.py: all broken tests have been disabled.
	Temporary made smaller tests to demonstrate what is actually
	working on all caldav servers I've tested against (Zimbra,
	DAViCal, Baikal and SoGo).

	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject): (internal change) set __str__ and
	__repr__ to make debugging easier

	* caldav/objects.py: (internal change) Since the principal path and the calendar
	home set path are different on most CALDav server implementations,
	a new class CalendarSet has been made.

	* caldav/lib/url.py: (internal change) Complete rewrite and
	API-change. internally all URLs are now handled as objects

	* caldav/objects.py (Principal): (internal change) made it
	possible to set principal.calendar_home_set (hardly useful except
	for from the unit testing code).

	* All files: misc minor changes to reflect all the changes above.

2011-01-22  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py (Expand.__init__, 
							   TimeRange.__init__) : Fixed strftime fmt.

2010-10-09  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* All files: Made PEP8 compliant 

2010-10-04  Olivier Larchevêque <olivier.larcheveque@gmail.com>

    * caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.request): fix headers merge before sending request
    * caldav/objects.py (Event.__init__): fix for respecting davobject signature

2010-07-15  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.__init__): Fixed an issue with usernames
	that contain a '@'.
	Thanks to the reporter of issue #2

2010-07-07  Mark Meyer  <ofosos@gmail.com>

	* caldav/elements/cdav.py: Add Calendar, representing the calendar
	resource type.
	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject.children): Pull in code from
	_get_properties to enable PROPFINDs for properties with complex
	values.
	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject.properties): Add a warning message.
	* caldav/objects.py (Principal.calendars): retrieve only child
	collections that have a cdav.Calendar property.
	
2010-07-06  Mark Meyer  <ofosos@gmail.com>

	* caldav/objects.py (DAVObject.save): Use idiomatic
	NotImplementedError and add a docstring
	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVObject.request): raise error on a http
	unauthorized (400) condition.

2010-07-06  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* caldav/elements/base.py (BaseElement.__add__): Removed unnecessary
	verification.
	* caldav/objects.py: Merged all methods from caldav.lib.commands.
	* caldav/commands.py: Removed, no longer needed.

2010-07-05  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* caldav/lib/commands.py (date_search): Fixed a typo.
	* caldav/lib/error.py (AuthorizationError): Added AuthorizationError.
	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.request): Added 403 error handling.
	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.__init__): Always pass proper Content-Type
	and Accept headers to the server. This is required by at least davical.
	Thanks to http://bitbucket.org/ofosos (all of the above)

2010-07-02  Cyril Robert <cyrilrbt@gmail.com>

	* caldav/lib/commands.py (get_properties): Merged patch from issue #1.
	Thanks to http://bitbucket.org/ofosos

	* caldav/davclient.py (DAVClient.put): Added a new "headers" parameter.
	* caldav/lib/commands.py (create_event): Added headers for content-type.
	* caldav/lib/commands.py: Added basic error management throughout the file.
